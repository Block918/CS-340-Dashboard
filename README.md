# CS-340-Dashboard

Writing programs that are maintainable and readable comes with writing industry standard code that is well commented, therefore anyone can easily read and update the code as needed for the project. It can even be reused for another project if it is well written. As a computer scientist I approach problems as they arrive by tearing them down this allows me smaller portions to look at and find solutions for instead of overwhelming myself with a bigger problem. I approached this project by building it in sections which is how I do work most of the time this just seems to make it a little easier for me to take on a bigger project having it separated into smaller portions. Computer scientists identify and solve foundational problems in computing. This matters because they can create better experiences for users of the programs and the computing world. For this particular project the dashboard will help access information and allow for easy updating on the information for the company.
